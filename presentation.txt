In the tech space, open-source development has become a popular way of getting things done .
With tools like Git and GitHub, it's easy to find open-source projects that you can,
with a command, begin to collaborate on.

With this collaborative effort, new and creative ideas are emerging at a tremendous rate.

Examples: Linux, React, OpenAI, and Mozilla Firefox

Other then in Tech, there are many areas that are yet to benefit from this open-source paradigm.


	-	If you look at all the classic literature out there, you'll find many masterpieces
		written by a single person. 

	-	With movies, a script is typically written by a single person.

	-	For TV, there is usually 8-12 writers on average.

Think of your favorite book, movie, or TV series. Now imagine what could be possible
with more minds on the problem. 

Have any of you watched all of Game of Thrones? Imagine how much more cohesive the story could have been
if they had hundereds of people working on it instead of waiting around for one person to generate a thousand
page novel.

This is an easy enough problem to solve and there are apps out there that do just this 
for coding. Moving literature into the open-source space would be an enormous step forward
and I propose that four of us do just that.
